              Aligned with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3.5, this
              project raises awareness of substance use disorders and promotes
              voluntary treatment through creative communication. In Vietnam, only
              90,869 of 220,904 registered people who use drugs are engaged in
              structured rehabilitation (Ministry of Public Security 2024, cited
              in Nguyen et al. 2025). While 43% are placed in compulsory
              rehabilitation centres, 85.6% relapse within 12 months (Nguyen et
              al. 2025). In Viet Nam, drug addiction treatment has traditionally
              relied heavily on compulsory institutional care. In 2019, 76.8% of
              people receiving institutional treatment were treated compulsorily,
              compared with 19.2% voluntarily. Meanwhile, around 800
              community-based treatment and support sites operated across 23
              cities and provinces, although relapse and unemployment remained
              significant challenges (Le et al. 2024).

              Featuring one of the most talented, famous figure of the music
              industry who has overcome addiction - while also advocating for
              rehabilitation of substance abuse victims, Elton John quoted: “I
              finally summoned up the courage to say three words that would change
              my life ‘I need help’” (John 2026, cited in Broomall 2026). This
              marked his voluntary in seeking entry to rehabilitation in 1990,
              with the help of his loved ones. He later described rehabilitation
              as a freeing experience that helped him rediscover joy in life
              (Broomall 2026). Influenced by his strong will and resilience, our
              call to action aims to erase stigma formed that revolves around
              substance abuse victim, encourage people to see them beyond their
              suffering: “You saw the addiction. Did you see the person?”.
              Targeting young Vietnamese adults to perceive how addiction could
              affect a person through multiple factors - the campaign highlights a
              sense of immersive nostalgia with 2000s aesthetic of an instant
              messaging browser, lead the user with a plot line of familiarity
              when the victim, is the one you care about.
